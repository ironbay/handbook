## Values

- Our values listed here are simply a declaration of our preferences.
- They guide us in creating our ideal environment.
- They are explicitly not universal truths.
- We should be able to articulate a valid argument against all of our values

### 1. Build long term relationships

**Our Preference**: We are looking for people who we can work with for the rest of our lives. The intent is to build long term relationships so we don't sweat short term frictions. This means an above average level of closeness with the people you work with.

**Counter**: All of life doesn't have to be centered around work. It can be healthy to have a clear seperation between work life and personal life.

### 2. Avoid best practices

**Our Preference**: Best practices help avoid ruin rather than achieve greatness - they guarantee mediocrity. We are intentional about everything we do and want to find the best possible way to approach every problem. Nothing is every chosen simply because it is best practice.

**Counter**: Best practices reduce risk. It is unlikely you will have the time to innovate across many dimensions so it can be efficient to borrow good ideas from people who have done it before. You should specialize and focus on the narrowest area that you can define.

### 3. Own our tooling

**Our Preference**: something

**Counter**: Building your own tooling can be risky. Not every idea you have will be good and can end up being a massive opportunity cost that prevents you from doing what you actually need to do.

### 4. Avoid venture capital

**Our Preference**: Venture capital is a distorter of businesses. They involve a party that is seemingly aligned but in practice serves as a massive distraction. Most venture capitalists add negative value to companies.

**Counter**: If you want to make an impact of a certain size it is basically impossible to do so without venture capital. When it is applied to a solid foundation, venture capital can take businesses to a level that could never have reached organically.

---

### 5. Fully distributed team

**Our Preference**: Our team is entirely distributed. There are no requirements on where anyone needs to be regardless of their role. We put in the effort to develop lightweight processes to enable this. Any challenge that feels like it can be solved by colocating is indicative of a deeper problem.

**Counter**: People are hard wired to cooperate in person. Certain things feel entirely unnatural when attempting to do them remotely. The line between work and personal life starts to blur when they're not seperated geographically.
